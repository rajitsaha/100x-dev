pair-loop.py — CLI orchestration for the /pair-loop handoff skill.

The interactive agent running the skill IS the coder; this CLI never simulates
coding. It owns: run bookkeeping (manifest + HANDOFF.md), the per-round budget
check, invoking the reviewer subprocess, and PR-body assembly. See
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-09-pair-loop-handoff-skill-design.md for the
full state machine.

Subcommands: start, budget-check, coder-done, review, finish.
