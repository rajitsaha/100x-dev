"""Manage optional third-party skill packs declared in packs/packs.json.

Packs are opt-in. Nothing here installs anything unless the user explicitly runs
`add`, and detection is strictly read-only: it reports which declared packs look
relevant to the current project and stops there.

Ownership is tracked per config entry, not per platform — see the state file shape
in docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-03-skill-packs.md. If the user already had a
plugin listed, we did not add it and will never remove it.

Subcommands:
  detect  — which declared packs match the current project (read-only)
  status  — every declared pack, its detection result, and its install state
  add     — install a pack
  remove  — reverse what we recorded inserting
  sync    — re-apply opted-in packs; drop packs no longer declared
